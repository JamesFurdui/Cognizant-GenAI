    "The quality of the image decreases as the truncation value increases. When the truncation is set at a lower value like 0.1, the images that are being output are much more realistic and contain fewer distortions compared to if the truncation was set to a value like 0.9. Setting a higher truncation comes with the side-effect of less realistic images but with a much more diverse output. "
